    "6. Write a python script (in a text editor or IDE) that calculates the area of a circle with radius `n`, where `n` is a variable containing any value and prints the value to the terminal. pi is roughly 3.14 but if you add the following line of code to the begining of your script, you can use `pi` for pi: `from math import pi`. We'll discuss importing modules later in the course. \n",

    "7. If you haven't already done so, modify the script from above with a comment embedded in the code describing what is being done.\n",

    "8. Write a script that calculates the remainder of a division between two numbers, assigned to the variables `num1` and `num2`. Assign the remainder to a third variable, `rem`, and then print the remainder to the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Write a script that calculates the division of two numbers and returns an integer value (no digits after the decimal point; use the floor operator - `//`). What happens if you use negative numbers?\n",

    "10. Using the code cell below, print some lyrics of song you know by heart split between three separate `print()` functions. Notice that the lyrics in each `print()` function are printed on separate lines. By default, the `print()` function appends a new line (`\\n`). You can specify something other than `\\n`. For example, if you didn't want any additional characters included in each `print()` statement, you could use `print (\"string\", end='')`. What happens if you edit your code with `end=''` within the `print` functions? What about `end=','` or `end='\\t'`?"
